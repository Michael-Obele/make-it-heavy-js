## 📅 July 21, 2025: The Great Cleanup and Reinforcement Day! 🧹✨

What a day for tidying up and solidifying our foundations! We've been busy behind the scenes, making sure everything is spick and span, and rock-solid for future adventures.

### 💾 Structured Output Saving: Neat and Tidy Results!

We've implemented a fantastic new feature that ensures all your script outputs are saved in a highly organized manner.

- **Automatic Markdown Output!** All generated outputs are now automatically saved to markdown files within a structured directory format: `output/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<prompt_name>.md`. This makes reviewing and tracking your results a breeze!

### 🌐 Enhanced Web Search: Smarter and More Resilient!

Our web search tool (`search_web`) has received a significant upgrade, making it more reliable and user-friendly.

- **DuckDuckGo Powered!** The web search now leverages DuckDuckGo for more accurate and comprehensive results.
- **Improved Error Handling!** We've enhanced the tool's ability to handle `403 Forbidden` errors gracefully, including an updated `User-Agent` to improve success rates. More descriptive error messages will now guide you if issues arise.

### � Documentation Dojo: Leaner, Meaner, and Clearer!

We kicked off the day with a massive documentation overhaul. Out with the old, in with the gold!

- **Farewell, Old Docs!** We've said goodbye to some deprecated documentation files, including those old migration summaries and status reports. It was time to clear the digital clutter and make room for shinier, more relevant info.
- **Env.Example Gets a Glow-Up!** Our `env.example` file got a much-needed facelift. Now, setting up your environment is smoother than ever, with crystal-clear instructions and descriptions for exciting new options like `DEBUG` and `URL`. No more head-scratching!
- **The Grand Migration Summary!** We've finally documented the monumental project refactor in `MIGRATION-SUMMARY.md`. This isn't just a document; it's a historical record outlining the major issues we squashed, the improvements we baked in, and the architectural magic that made it all possible.
- **A Brand New README Experience!** Prepare your eyes for the comprehensive `README-NEW.md`! This beauty provides everything you need to know about usage, features, and setup. It's your new best friend for getting started with Make It Heavy. We also updated the existing `README-FIXED.md` to highlight all the awesome fixes and shiny new features.
- **Status Report: All Systems Go!** The `STATUS-FIXED.md` file now gives you the lowdown on the project's current health, the issues we've conquered, and a sneak peek at our exciting next steps.

### 🛠️ Under the Hood: Refactoring for Glory!

Our engineering wizards have been hard at work, making the core of Make It Heavy more robust and elegant.

- **Valibot Takes the Stage!** We've made a significant upgrade to our configuration validation, switching from Zod to the mighty Valibot! This brings improved type safety and even better validation rules, making our configuration handling super reliable.
- **Codebase Spring Cleaning!** We swept away deprecated entry points (`index.ts`) and legacy migration scripts that were no longer needed. A cleaner codebase is a happier codebase!
- **Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3!** We added a whole new suite of tests for our updated features. This means more stability, fewer bugs, and critical paths covered. We're serious about quality!
- **Search Tool Gets Smarter!** Our web search tool received a little tweak, updating its user agent for improved compatibility. Now it plays even nicer with the internet!
